      "1 \n \nINTRODUCTION, INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE,  \nAND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nLast year, the Supreme Court held that abortion is a matter that is entrusted \nto “the people and their elected representatives” to address.",
      "Overruling precedent \nthat took that authority away from the people, the Court returned the issue of \n“regulating or prohibiting abortion” to “the citizens of each State.” Ibid.",
      "States may \nthus pursue their “legitimate interests” in protecting unborn life, women’s health, \nand the medical profession’s integrity by regulating or restricting abortion.",
      "Like other States, amici have, consistent with the Constitution and \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, adopted laws regulating abortion—including \nchemical abortion.",
      "Some States have \nchosen to adopt or maintain tighter restrictions and more thorough regulations on \nabortion after Dobbs.",
      "All States have provisions in their abortion laws to protect a woman’s life \nand commonly include exceptions in other circumstances.",
      "The \nAdministration’s actions on abortion drugs typify that effort.",
      "The President soon signed an executive order \nlamenting States’ regulation of abortion and directing federal agencies to “expand \naccess to abortion care, including medication abortion.” Protecting Access to \nReproductive Healthcare Services, Exec.",

      "3 \n \nFor two decades, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has acted to establish a \nnationwide regime of on-demand abortion by licensing sweeping access to chemical \nabortion drugs—in defiance of federal and state laws protecting life, health, and \nsafety.",
      "In 2000, the FDA purported to approve the drug \nmifepristone for chemically induced abortions through 49 days of pregnancy.",
      "That \napproval had basic legal problems of its own, but it did include safety measures to \naccount for mifepristone’s serious risks to life and health.",
      "Yet over time the FDA has \ncast even those measures aside.",
      "In 2016, the FDA rolled back many safety \nrequirements—allowing mifepristone to be prescribed later in pregnancy, by non-\ndoctors, and with only one in-person visit.",
      "In 2021, the agency halted the remaining \nin-person dispensing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic and later \nabandoned the requirements altogether.",
      "After decades of such efforts, the FDA now \nbroadly condones a wide-ranging mail-order abortion-drug regime.",
      "Plaintiffs here \nhave moved to preliminarily enjoin and set aside the FDA’s actions.",
      "This brief explains why the public interest and equities strongly support relief \nagainst the FDA’s actions.",
      "First, the FDA’s actions contravene federal law and so \ndisserve the public interest.",
      "Second, the FDA’s actions defy the public-interest \ndeterminations made by the amici States, which are entrusted with balancing the \npolicy and equitable considerations in this area.",
      "Last, the FDA’s actions threaten to \nundermine the amici States’ enforcement of duly enacted laws and thus undercut the \npublic interest that those laws promote.",
      "For these reasons, injunctive relief against \nthe FDA’s actions would promote the public interest.",
      "4 \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act directs the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration to “protect the public health by ensuring that ... human and \nveterinary drugs are safe and effective.” 21 U.S.C.",
      "Under the Act, the \nFDA is responsible for approving any “new drug” before it is marketed and distributed \nto the public.",
      "The Act bars anyone from “introduc[ing] or deliver[ing] \nfor introduction into interstate commerce any new drug” without FDA “approval.” Id.",
      "To obtain FDA approval, a new drug must undergo an extensive process \nwith rigorous testing.",
      "The FDA’s conclusion that a drug is safe and effective must be \nbased on “substantial evidence” of expert consensus.",
      "In 2000, the FDA approved the marketing and distribution of mifepristone for \n“the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 49 days’ pregnancy.” \nApp.518, Dkt.",
      "Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid that causes “menstrual bleeding, \ndisruption of the endometrium [or uterine lining], and then termination” of a \npregnancy.",
      "Mifepristone, NIH, Nat’l Library of Medicine, http://bit.ly/403EjSN.",
      "Mifepristone is generally followed by a dose of misoprostol, which causes the pregnant \nwoman’s uterus to contract and expel the detached embryo.",
      "The FDA approved mifepristone under Subpart H of the agency’s regulations, \nwhich implement the agency’s general authority to approve new drugs that “have \nbeen studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening \nillnesses,” 21 C.F.R.",
      "To satisfy Subpart H, the FDA needed to—and did—deem \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 100   Filed 02/13/23    Page 10 of 26   PageID 3769",
      "5 \n \npregnancy a “serious or life-threatening illness[ ]” (even in the absence of \ncomplications) and conclude that mifepristone was “safe[ ]” and “provide[d] \nmeaningful therapeutic benefit.” App.523 (citing 21 C.F.R.",
      "Despite approving mifepristone, the FDA recognized the serious risk of “urgent \nadverse event[s] associated with” the drug—including incomplete abortions or severe \nbleeding requiring surgery.",
      "These risks increase later in pregnancy and in \ncases of ectopic pregnancy.",
      "The approval thus included \nrequirements that the drug be provided only “by or under the supervision of a \nphysician” with the ability to “assess the duration of pregnancy accurately,” “diagnose \nectopic pregnancies,” “provide [or arrange for] surgical intervention in cases of \nincomplete abortion or severe bleeding,” and “assure patient access to medical \nfacilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation.” App.523.",
      "In 2007, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Amendments \nAct, Pub.",
      "That law affected FDA approvals under \nSubpart H. It directed the agency to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy \n(REMS) for a new drug when “necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug \noutweigh the risks.” 21 U.S.C.",
      "A REMS operates as a “drug safety \nprogram” for medications that present “serious safety concerns.” U.S. Food & Drug \nAdmin., Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, http://bit.ly/3wKOwGp; see ibid.",
      "(“While all medications have labeling that informs health care stakeholders about \nmedication risks, only a few medications require a REMS.”).",
      "Because of the serious \nsafety concerns involved, the FDA established a REMS program for mifepristone in \n2011 with various “elements to assure safe use,” including a requirement that the \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 100   Filed 02/13/23    Page 11 of 26   PageID 3770",
      "6 \n \ndrug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings—clinics, medical offices, and \nhospitals—under the supervision of a certified prescriber.",
      "Despite the risks that the FDA itself recognized, over the next decade and \nbeyond, the Obama and Biden Administrations expanded mifepristone’s use and \ndropped the safety measures erected around it.",
      "In 2016, the FDA extended the \napproved use of mifepristone through 70 days (10 weeks) of pregnancy, allowed a \nbroader set of persons to prescribe the drug, and reduced the number of required in-\nperson patient visits from three to one.",
      "But the agency maintained \nthe requirement for at least one in-person visit so that the drug could be dispensed \nonly in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals under the supervision of a certified \nhealthcare provider.",
      "In April 2021, however, the FDA stopped enforcing the in-person-dispensing \nrequirements.",
      "The FDA attributed that decision to “COVID-related risks” of in-\nperson dispensing.",
      "The agency added that it would “exercise enforcement \ndiscretion during the COVID-19 [public-health emergency] with respect to the \ndispensing of mifepristone through the mail.” Ibid.",
      "In December 2021, the FDA abandoned the in-person dispensing requirement \naltogether.",
      "It made this decision independent of any COVID-related risks \nand despite recognizing that “certain elements of the Mifepristone REMS Program”—\nincluding “healthcare provider certification and dispensing of mifepristone to \npatients with evidence or other documentation of safe use conditions”—“remain \nnecessary to assure the safe use of mifepristone” and “ensure the benefits of \nmifepristone outweigh the risks.” Ibid.",

      "While the FDA is authorized to evaluate new drugs for safety and effectiveness, \nStates are primarily responsible for protecting the health and welfare of their \ncitizens.",
      "Many States, including several amici here, have thus enacted laws to \nregulate abortion-inducing drugs and account for their dangers.",
      "Such laws can \ninclude \nin-person \nexamination \nand dispensing \nrequirements, \nqualification \nrequirements for prescribers, mandates for informed consent, bans on distribution by \nmailing, or some combination of these and other safety limitations.",
      "The lawsuit here seeks to enjoin the panoply of agency actions through which \nthe FDA has approved mifepristone, made it widely accessible, and discarded \nmeasures to manage the risks that it presents.",
      "ARGUMENT \nThe Public Interest And Equities Support Injunctive Relief Against \nThe FDA’s Actions On Mifepristone.",
      "The FDA’s challenged actions on mifepristone are deeply flawed.",
      "The Public Interest And Equities Weigh Strongly Against The \nFDA’s Actions Because Those Actions Defy Federal Law.",
      "Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the FDA’s actions on mifepristone violate \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related FDA regulations.",
      "Amici emphasize that the FDA’s actions defy both the agency’s regulations and \nalso federal laws restricting the mailing of abortion drugs.",
      "The public interest and \nequities thus favor injunctive relief against the FDA’s actions.",
      "The FDA’s actions here have two basic legal flaws.",
      "First, the FDA’s approval of mifepristone defies the agency’s own regulations.",
      "As noted, the agency relied on Subpart H of its regulations when it first approved \nmifepristone in 2000.",
      "Subpart H permits the FDA to approve “certain new drug \nproducts that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious \nor life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to \npatients over existing treatments.” 21 C.F.R.",
      "That \nregulation doubly forecloses the FDA’s approval.",
      "Pregnancy is not an “illness[ ].” It is \na natural state essential to perpetuating human life.",
      "9 \n \npregnancy without complications is not a condition that is “serious or life-\nthreatening” or that requires the “treatment” mifepristone provides.",
      "The FDA admits that pregnancy is not an illness but claims that its \nrulemaking “explained that Subpart H was available for serious or life-threatening \n‘conditions,’ whether or not they were understood colloquially to be ‘illnesses.’” Opp.",
      "28 (quoting New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biological Drug Product Regulations; \nAccelerated Approval, 57 Fed.",
      "As \nexplained, that clear regulatory text defeats the FDA’s view and thus its approval of \nmifepristone.",
      "At most, the FDA’s argument suggests that it could have approved \nmifepristone under Subpart H for cases in which a pregnant woman’s life or health \nis seriously in danger.",
      "That is not what it did—and the FDA still would have been \nstuck with the reality that pregnancy is not an “illness[ ].” 21 C.F.R.",
      "Subpart H does not permit the agency to greenlight elective abortions on a wide scale.",
      "The FDA also claims that “any hypothetical error in the initial reliance on \nSubpart H” has “been overtaken by congressional action.” Opp.",
      "When Congress established the REMS framework in 2007, it \ntemporarily “deemed to have in effect an approved risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy” any “drug that was [previously] approved” under Subpart H with “elements \nto assure safe use,” Pub.",
      "at 950, and required the \nsponsors of such drugs to “submit to the [FDA] a proposed risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategy” within 180 days, id.",
      "10 \n \nthat Congress “deemed” preexisting safety requirements to be sufficient REMS \nprograms under the new 2007 law until a new strategy was approved.",
      "That law did \nnot affect whether a drug was properly authorized under Subpart H in the first place \nto treat “serious or life-threatening illnesses.” 21 C.F.R.",
      "Congressional \naction did not blot out the FDA’s defiance of its own regulation.",
      "Second, the FDA’s actions defy federal criminal law.",
      "Longstanding federal law \nprovides that “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing \nabortion ... [i]s declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the \nmails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.” 18 U.S.C.",
      "A \nrelated statute makes it a federal crime to “knowingly use[ ] any express company or \nother common carrier” to ship “in interstate or foreign commerce ... any drug, \nmedicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” Id.",
      "These statutes prohibit using the mail to send or \nreceive abortion-inducing drugs such as mifepristone.",
      "The statutes’ restrictions on \nabortion have remained in place—even as Congress has repealed other parts of these \nlaws.",
      "A late-breaking memo from the Biden Justice Department, see Application of the \nComstock Act to the Mailing of Prescription Drugs That Can Be Used for Abortions, \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 100   Filed 02/13/23    Page 16 of 26   PageID 3775",
      "The FDA’s challenged actions on mifepristone thus defy the agency’s \nregulatory authority and longstanding federal criminal law.",
      "Because those actions \nare at war with the law, the FDA cannot claim any public interest in enforcing them.",
      "Indeed, enjoining the FDA to “abide by” federal law would promote the public \ninterest, Biden, 10 F.4th at 559—and not issuing injunctive relief would “undermine” \nthe public interest, Valley, 118 F.3d at 1056.",
      "The \nFDA’s \nActions \nUndermine \nThe \nPublic-Interest \nDeterminations \nThat \nStates—Not \nFederal \nAgencies—Are \nEntitled To Make.",
      "The FDA was not responding to changed circumstances on the safety of \nmifepristone when it cast aside the longstanding requirements for in-person \ndispensing.",
      "Nor was the agency following any legislative mandate from Congress \nwhen promoting a new mail-order abortion regime.",
      "After that decision the Administration swiftly declared that duly enacted \nstate laws on abortion will have “devastating implications” for “public health” and \nthat the federal government would act to “expand access to abortion care, including \nmedication abortion,” Protecting Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services, Exec.",
      "12 \n \nthe Supreme Court recognized, it is the responsibility of elected representatives in \nStates—not unelected bureaucrats in federal agencies—to strike the balance between \n“competing interests” on abortion.",
      "The FDA’s actions seek \nto override the balance properly struck by States.",

      "Using this authority, States have adopted varying approaches to abortion that \nreflect the policy decisions of their constituent citizens.",
      "State laws restricting abortion \nubiquitously include provisions to protect a woman’s life.",
      "(abortion permitted “where the pregnancy was caused by rape”).",
      "Many States have \npassed laws that address the particular risks presented by chemical abortions.",
      "Such \nlaws recognize, for example, that “abortion-inducing drugs” “present[ ] significant \nmedical risks to women” such as “uterine hemorrhage, viral infections, pelvic \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 100   Filed 02/13/23    Page 18 of 26   PageID 3777",

      "§ 41-41-103(b); and “are \ncontraindicated in ectopic pregnancies,” id.",
      "Given those risks, States \nhave used their regulatory authority to direct (for example) that only physicians may \nprovide such drugs, that a physician may do so only after “physically examin[ing] the \nwoman and document[ing] ... the gestational age and intrauterine location of the \npregnancy,” and that abortion drugs “must be administered in the same room and in \nthe physical presence of the physician,” ensuring that the pregnant woman is \ninformed of risks and monitored for complications.",
      "§ 171.063(b-1) \n(prohibiting shipment of abortion-inducing drugs “by courier, delivery, or mail \nservice”).",
      "Last, like all methods of elective abortion, elective chemical abortion is \ngenerally unlawful in numerous States.",
      "§ 41-41-45(2) (abortion \nunlawful except “where necessary for the preservation of the mother’s life or where \nthe pregnancy was caused by rape”).",
      "In the actions at issue here, the FDA has sought to impose a federal mail-order \nabortion regime that disregards the protections for life, health, and safety adopted by \nnumerous States’ elected representatives.",
      "But the authority to “regulat[e] or \nprohibit[ ] abortion” belongs to “the citizens of each State.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284.",
      "The FDA may determine only whether mifepristone is “safe and effective” for its \nCase 2:22-cv-00223-Z   Document 100   Filed 02/13/23    Page 19 of 26   PageID 3778",
      "The agency has no authority to make broad \npolicy judgments balancing the people’s interests in “prenatal life at all stages of \ndevelopment,” “maternal health and safety,” and “the integrity of the medical \nprofession.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284.",
      "Insofar as the federal legislature has weighed in at all in this \narea, it has been to condemn what the FDA has done.",
      "Congress has expressly declared \nthat drugs “designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion ... shall not be \nconveyed in the mails.” 18 U.S.C.",
      "State laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue—\nand they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority).",

      "The Biden Administration claims that it has the power to broadly make \nabortion drugs accessible despite contrary determinations by States and despite \nregulations that States may have enacted to protect life, health, and safety in the use \nof those drugs.",
      "As discussed above, the relevant federal statutes \ncriminalize sending or receiving abortion drugs by mail and thus affirmatively \ncondemn the FDA’s actions.",

      "Such enforcement will be especially hard in these circumstances, given the \nAdministration’s position that it will not enforce existing federal restrictions on \nabortion drugs, will treat state laws as “barriers” to be avoided, and can be expected \nto stymie and defy States’ efforts to enforce their own laws.",
      "* \n* \n* \nThe serious nature of the FDA’s unlawful actions, and the agency’s decision to \ninvite lawbreaking by private parties and government actors across the country, \nfavors broad relief.",
